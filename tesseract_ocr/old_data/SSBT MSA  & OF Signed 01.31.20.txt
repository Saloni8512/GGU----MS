Security Incidents, subject to Section 8.2., (iii) indemnification obligations, or (iv) for gross negligence,

acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any claims arising from an alleged Security Incident where
such claim concerns State Street Personal Data, as defined in Exhibit E, to the extent that the Customer
incurs damages, MetricStream’s liability shall be determined as follows:

 

a. to the extent such Security Incident occurred despite MetricStream’s (and its Affiliates and
subcontractors) material compliance with the obligations under Section 9, the Security Schedule
and Data Processing Addendum, as applicable, MetricStream’s total liability shall be limited to
one million US dollars ($1.000.000), provided. that MetricStream shall not be liable for
consequential damages constituting lost profits, drop in share price, reputational harm, or
diminution to value;

b. to the extent such Security Incident occurred and MetricStream (and its Affiliates and
subcontractors) was not in material compliance with its obligations under Section 9, the Security
Schedule and Data Processing Addendum, as applicable, there shall be no limitation on
MetricStream’s liability for damages, provided that (i) MetricStream shall not be liable for
consequential damages constituting lost profits, drop in share price, reputational harm, or
diminution to value, and (ii) Customer materially complied with its own internal policy with
respect to the use and redaction of State Street Data on the Cloud Services, the policy being
attached hereto as Exhibit K;

State Street Data than State Street Personal Data, State Street shall not be prevented from
bringing any such additional claim, which shall not be subject to limitations under Section 8.2.

misconduct or fraud.

Provider shall have implemented, and shall thereafter maintain current, a comprehensive security
policy or policies (“Security Policy”) that satisfies the requirements set forth below. Service Provider
agrees that it shall not make any change(s) to its Security Policy that effectively reduces or limits the
rights or protections offered to State Street under this Schedule generally.

Upon request by State Street on an annual basis, the Service Provider shall provide State Street's
Chief Information Security Officer or his or her designee with a copy of its then current Security
Policy and an opportunity to discuss Service Provider's security measures with a qualifi ied IT
management member of Service Provider. The Security Policy must reflect security measures added
as a result of risk assessment findings.

Service Provider shall review its Security Policy regularly, and particularly following any changes in
applicable law, advances in technology or changes to the Service Provider's information systems, in
order to verify that the Security Policy and controls set out therein remain accurate, comprehensive
and up to date.

Standards of Protection

Service Provider shall secure and protect State Street Data by using at least the same degree of care
as the Service Provider uses to secure and protect its own confidential and proprietary information

16. Definitions and Guidance

For the purpose of this Schedule, the following Cloud Computing terms are defined according to
NIST Special Publication 800-145 (Revision September 2014):

Cloud computing is a mode! for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to
a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage,
applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal
management effort or service provider interaction.

Software as a Service (SaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's
applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various
client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based
email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud
infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual
application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user-specific application
configuration settings.

Platform as a Service (PaaS}. The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the
cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications created using programming

Information Classification: Limited Access
GPS# 180319755629459 34
MetricStream Confidential

languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not
manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating
systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration
settings for the application-hosting environment.
Infrastructure as a Service (laaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision
processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the
consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and
applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but
has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited
control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization
comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated
by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off
premises.
Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific
community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security
requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated
by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of
them, and it may exist on or off premises.
Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public, It may
be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or
some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound
together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability
(e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

b. For the purpose of this Schedule, the Penetration Testing terms defined as:

State Street Data Environment (SSDE) is defined as the people, processes, and technology that
store, process, or transmit State Street Data or sensitive authentication data.

Critical Systems are systems involved in the processing or protection of State Street Data. For
example, security systems, public-facing devices and systems, databases, and other systems that
store, process, or transmit State Street Data. However, for the purposes of a penetration test,
there may be additional systems outside the SSDE boundaries that could affect the security of
the SSDE. Common examples of critical systems relevant to a penetration test might include:
security systems (for example, firewalls, intrusion-detection systems/intrusion-prevention
systems (IDS/IPS), authentication servers, etc.), or any assets utilized by privileged users to
support and manage the SSDE.

The following guidance applies to Penetration Testing scope:

i. The scope of an external penetration test is the exposed external perimeter of the SSDE
and critical systems connected or accessible to public network infrastructures. It should
assess any unique access to the scope from the public networks, including services that
have access restricted to individual external IP addresses. Testing must include both
application-layer and network-layer assessments. External penetration tests also include
remote access vectors such as dial-up and VPN connections.

ii. | The scope of the internal penetration test is the internal perimeter of the SSDE from the
perspective of any out-of-scope LAN segment that has access to a unique type of attack
on the SSDE perimeter. Critical systems or those systems that may impact the security of
the SSDE should also be included in the scope. Testing must include both application-
layer and network-layer assessments.

iii, If segmentation controls have been implemented to separate environments,
segmentation checks should be performed from any non-SSDE environment that is
intended to be completely segmented from the SSDE perimeter. The intent of this
assessment is to validate the effectiveness of the segmentation controls separating the
non-SSDE environments from the SSDE and ensure the controls are operational.

iv. To be considered out of scope of SSDE penetration test, a system component must be
isolated (segmented) from the SSDE, such that even if the out-of-scope system
component was compromised it could not impact the security of the SSDE. Therefore,
the penetration test may include systems not directly related to the processing,
transmission or storage of State Street Data to ensure these assets, if compromised,
could not impact the security of the SSDE.

if access to the SSDE is obtained as a result of the testing, it is recommended to continue exploring
inside the network and further the attack against other systems within the CDE, and also include testing
any data-exfiltration prevention (data-loss prevention) controls that are in place.

SERVICE PROVIDER PERSONNEL

 

Without limitation of any obligation under the Principal Agreement(s), Service Provider
undertakes that it and each Service Provider Affiliate shall take all reasonable steps to ensure
the reliability of any employee, agent or contractor of any Contracted Processor who may have
access to the State Street Personal Data, ensuring that all such individuals are subject to
confidentiality undertakings or professional or statutory obligations of confidentiality, and

STANDARD CONTRACTUAL CLAUSES

For the purposes of Article 26(2) of Directive 95/46/EC for the transfer of personal data to processors
established in third countries which do not ensure an adequate level of data protection

each a ‘party’; together ‘the parties’,

HAVE AGREED on the following Contractual Clauses (the Clauses) in order to adduce adequate
safeguards with respect to the protection of privacy and fundamental rights and freedoms of individuals
for the transfer by the data exporter to the data importer of the personal data specified in Exhibit 1.

Clause 1
Definitions
For the purposes of the Clauses:

(a) ‘personal data’, ‘special categories of data’, ‘process/processing’, ‘controller’, ‘processor’, ‘data
subject’ and ‘supervisory authority’ shall have the same meaning as in Directive 95/46/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with
regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (°);

(b

—

‘the data exporter’ means the controller who transfers the personal data;

(c

—

‘the data importer’ means the processor who agrees to receive from the data exporter personal
data intended for processing on his behalf after the transfer in accordance with his instructions and
the terms of the Clauses and who is not subject to a third country’s system ensuring adequate
protection within the meaning of Article 25(1) of Directive 95/46/EC;

(d

—

‘the sub-processor’ means any processor engaged by the data importer or by any other sub-
processor of the data importer who agrees to receive from the data importer or from any other sub-
processor of the data importer personal data exclusively intended for processing activities to be
carried out on behalf of the data exporter after the transfer in accordance with his instructions, the
terms of the Clauses and the terms of the written subcontract;

(e

—

‘the applicable data protection law’ means the legislation protecting the fundamental rights and
freedoms of individuals and, in particular, their right to privacy with respect to the processing of
personal data applicable to a data controller in the Member State in which the data exporter is

Details of the transfer

The details of the transfer and in particular the special categories of personal data where applicable are
specified in Exhibit 1 which forms an integral part of the Clauses.

Clause 3
Third-party beneficiary clause

1. The data subject can enforce against the data exporter this Clause, Clause 4(b) to (i), Clause 5{a) to
(e), and (g) to (j), Clause 6(1) and (2), Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12 as third-party
beneficiary.

2. The data subject can enforce against the data importer this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause
6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where the data exporter has factually disappeared
or has ceased to exist in law unless any successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the
data exporter by contract or by operation of law, as a result of which it takes on the rights and
obligations of the data exporter, in which case the data subject can enforce them against such entity.

3. The data subject can enforce against the sub-processor this Clause, Clause 5(a) to (e) and (g), Clause
6, Clause 7, Clause 8(2), and Clauses 9 to 12, in cases where both the data exporter and the data
importer have factually disappeared or ceased to exist in law or have become insolvent, unless any
successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter by contract or by
operation of law as a result of which it takes on the rights and obligations of the data exporter, in which
case the data subject can enforce them against such entity. Such third-party liability of the sub-
processor shall be limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

requests or if such deposit is required under the applicable data protection law.

2, The parties agree that the supervisory authority has the right to conduct an audit of the data
importer, and of any sub-processor, which has the same scope and is subject to the same conditions as
would apply to an audit of the data exporter under the applicable data protection law.

3. The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter about the existence of legislation
applicable to it or any sub-processor preventing the conduct of an audit of the data importer, or any
sub-processor, pursuant to paragraph 2. In such a case the data exporter shall be entitled to take the
measures foreseen in Clause 5(b).

Clause 9
Governing law
The Clauses shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established.
Clause 10

Clause 11
Sub-processing

1. The data importer shall not subcontract any of its processing operations performed on behalf of the
data exporter under the Clauses without the prior written consent of the data exporter. Where the data
importer subcontracts its obligations under the Clauses, with the consent of the data exporter, it shall
do so only by way of a written agreement with the sub-processor which imposes the same obligations
on the sub-processor as are imposed on the data importer under the Clauses ( 1}. Where the sub-
processor fails to fulfil its data protection obligations under such written agreement the data importer
shall remain fully liable to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor’s obligations

bring the claim for compensation referred to in paragraph 1 of Clause 6 against the data exporter or the
data importer because they have factually disappeared or have ceased to exist in law or have become
insolvent and no successor entity has assumed the entire legal obligations of the data exporter or data
importer by contract or by operation of law. Such third-party liability of the sub-processor shall be
limited to its own processing operations under the Clauses.

3. The provisions relating to data protection aspects for sub-processing of the contract referred to in
paragraph 1 shall be governed by the law of the Member State in which the data exporter is established,
namely, the United Kingdom.

4. The data exporter shall keep a list of sub-processing agreements concluded under the Clauses and
notified by the data importer pursuant to Clause 5(j), which shall be updated at least once a year. The
list shall be available to the data exporter’s data protection supervisory authority.

Clause 12
Obligation after the termination of personal data-processing services

1. The parties agree that on the termination of the provision of data-processing services, the data
importer and the sub-processor shall, at the choice of the data exporter, return all the personal data
transferred and the copies thereof to the data exporter or shall destroy all the personal data and certify
to the data exporter that it has done so, unless legislation imposed upon the data importer prevents it
from returning or destroying all or part of the personal data transferred. In that case, the data importer
warrants that it will guarantee the confidentiality of the personal data transferred and will not actively
process the personal data transferred anymore.

2. The data importer and the sub-processor warrant that upon request of the data exporter and/or of
the supervisory authority, it will submit its data-processing facilities for an audit of the measures
referred to in paragraph 1.

Audit Methodology — Information Classification — Use of Personal Data

Handling of Pll in Internal Audit Workpapers

e Audit workpapers are restricted to Corporate Audit staff for viewing except when requested
by regulators or other external parties approved in line with the Corporation’s Supplemental
Requirements for NIST 800 53R4 Standards. Audit workpapers are not provided to
customers of State Street.

e Though workpapers are classified as limited access and upon discussion with the Privacy
Office, personal data is allowed to be within the audit workpapers and attachments without
further access restriction or redaction on the condition that only data necessary to conduct
testing is retained. In most cases, a single, unique “identifier” (e.g., legal entity ID, account
#, employee #) is used and other Pll is redacted.

e Per discussion with the audit owners, “higher risk” personal data that may be
included in audits of Global Human Resources (e.g., incentive compensation,
payroll), Global Security (e.g., background checks, investigations) and Corporate
Compliance (e.g., know your customer requirements and files. IN these cases the
audit owners either (a) did not include the high risk Pll at all and only described the
data so that another individual could run the same report or (b) redacted the data to
only include a single unique identifier .Further, audit owners confirmed that where
possible, documentation is reviewed on-site or live rather than obtaining electronic
support

e The main scenario where we are aware of two identifiers being used is user access testing,
which may include employee name and employment ID.

Controls in Place
e There are two key controls in every audit to prevent the inclusion of personal data:

o All workpapers undergo at least one level of review, typically by an AVP or above, to
approve content and a final review, typically by a VP or above, to close the audit and
confirm compliance with information classification requirements

e In addition to these controls, Audit’s Quality Assurance team reviews a sample of audits
each year for compliance with our methodologies, including information classification
standards
